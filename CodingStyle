LCD4Linux Coding Style

We decided to use a common coding style to make patches and diffs 
easier to read and apply.

The style we use is based on Kernighan & Ritchie and the coding style 
of the linux kernel (see /usr/src/linux/Documentation/CodingStyle),
with some differences:

- we use a indentation level of 4 spaces (Linus prefers 8)
- we allow lines up to 150 chars (Linus uses 80)

The resulting indent command is:
indent -kr -l150

There's a script called 'indent.sh' that comes with the LCD4Linux 
source package; all it does is call indent with all .c and .h files.

It is always a good idea to call 'indent.sh' before any CVS operation,
this ensures that diffs and updates won't get mixed up because of
cosmetic changes.
