This is the README file for lcd4linux


INTRODUCTION 

lcd4linux is a small program that reads various information from the kernel
(and probably from other subsystems, especially ISDN) and displays them on a LCD.

It supports displaying text values and different types of bars: Horizontal and
vertical bars, logarithmic bars, split bars (two independent bars in one row).


USAGE

lcd4linux -h  
  print version number and a small help text, then exit

lcd4linux -l 
  list available drivers

lcd4linux -d
  calibrate delay loop (necessary for some drivers)

lcd4linux [-c key=val] [-F] [-f config-file] [-o output] [-q] [-v]
  run lcd4linux 
  overwrite entries from the config-file with '-c'
  do not fork and detach with '-F'
  use configuration from 'config-file' instead of /etc/lcd4linux.conf
  write picture to 'output' (raster driver only)
  suppress startup splash screen with '-q'
  generate info messages with '-v'
  generate debugging messages with '-vv'


SUPPORTED DISPLAYS

* Matrox Orbital: <http://www.matrixorbital.com>
	
  "LCD0821": 2 lines by  8 characters
  "LCD1621": 2 lines by 16 characters
  "LCD2021": 2 lines by 20 characters
  "LCD2041": 4 lines by 20 characters (tested)
  "LCD4021": 2 lines by 40 characters


* CrystalFontz <http://www.crystalfontz.com>

  any of 626, 632, 634 and 636.


* HD44780-based displays

  This driver supports display modules based on the Hitachi HD44780 chip,
  connected to a parallel port. These displays are made by different 
  manufactures, and come in various sizes.


* PalmOrb

  I was told that lcd4linux works fine with PalmOrb, a small program that 
  emulates a Matrox Orbital display on the Palm Pilot.


* X11
  thanks to Herbert Rosmanith <herp@wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at> a driver
  for the X Window System is available. It supports any size at any
  resolution. A very small XLCD4Linux-Window can even swallow on the KDE
  Panel!


* Raster formats:
  a generic raster driver (which is used by the X11-driver, too) is availiable,
  it supports:
     PPM (portable pixmap)
     PNG (with libgd)


* other displays: lcd4linux and especially the display driver code is very
  modular, so it should be quite easy to write a driver for any display. See
  README.driver for details. Contributors are welcome!!!


CONFIGURATION

The configuration file (default: /etc/lcd4linux.conf) has a very simple
format: Every line consists of a key and a value, seperated by whitespace
(blanks or tabs). Values can contain whitespace, and can be enclosed in
single or double quotes. A key must not contain whitespace. Keys are NOT
case-sensitive. Order doesn't matter. Empty lines and all text on a line
after a '#' will be ignored. If you want to use '#' in a value (think of
X11-colors), you have to quote it with a backslash.

NOTE:

Because of security reasons the config file is assured to be:
   * - file is a normal file (or /dev/null)
   * - file owner is owner of program
   * - file is not accessible by group
   * - file is not accessible by other
   
So if you run lcd4linux as root, /etc/lcd4linux has to be:
  chmod 600
  chown root.root


The configuration file contains information for different modules of
lcd4linux:

Global options:

  tick: time in milliseconds between bar updates
  tack: time in milliseconds between text updates (text can be updated less 
        often than bars, so you get a smooth bar display and readable text)
  tau:  time constant (in milliseconds) for damping function (not used by now)

Data-specific options:

  overload: load average threshold and bar scaling. The '%L' token (see below)
            displays a '!' instead of a blank if the current load average 
	    exceeds this value. 
            load bars are scaled by this value (load=overload gives 100%)
  fifo: path to fifo for communication with isdnlog (not yet implemented)
  sensor1: path to the 1st temperature file 
           (e.g. /proc/sys/dev/sensors/w83781d-isa-0290/temp1)
           it is important that you use the isa sensors, because the i2c 
	   sensors are very slow!
  sensor1_min: temperature where the corresponding bar starts
  sensor1_max: temperature where bar ends
  sensor[2..9], -_min, -_max: entries for the 2nd to 9th temperature sensor
  
  exec:
     x1 ... x9: command to execute, PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
                $X1 ... $X8 is result of command 1..8 in environment
     Tick_x1 .. 9 delay in ticks (overrides delay_x)
     Delay_x1 ..9 delay in seconds (default 1)
     Scale_x1 ..9 scale for bars (default 100)
     
  battery: Battwarning 10 (default 10)
   
 
Driver-specific options:
  
  Display: the name of a display model (see "supported displays" above)
  every driver has its own configuration options (e.g. 'Port', 'Speed', ...)
  see README.<Drivername> for details!
  
  
Display options:
  
  row1: Text to display in row 1
  row[2-max]: Text to display in other rows

  The text to be displayed can contain specific directives, which will be
  replaced by the appropriate values, or will create bars:

  '\nnn` will write the ASCII-character nnn (octal)
  '%<token>' will be replaced by the value of <token>
  '%%' will write a '%'
  '%$' will write a '$'

  '$<direction><length><token>[+<token>] will create a bar with the
  specified direction and length (in characters) with the value of <token>.
  If the driver supports dual bars, you can specify the second value with
  '+<token>'. <direction> can be 'l' (left), 'r' (right), 'u' (up) or 'd'
  (down). If you specify the direction in upper case, a logarithmic bar will
  be created. note that the space occupied by a bar always grows from left
  to right or from top to bottom, regardless of the direction!
